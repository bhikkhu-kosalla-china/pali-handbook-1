# Quotations that end in - iti and types of translations
A **quotation** can be defined as *the citation of a word or words, spoken or thought of*.
It can be recognized by the indeclinable *iti* added to its end.

## It can be dealt in two ways.

1. The whole set of quoted words is viewed as a single noun and related to “iti” in Quoted Speech Relation(QUS) and “iti” itself related to a corresponding verb in Quotation Marker relation (QUM).
The quoted speech itself may be **translated** or
**not**.
>Ex. puriso gacchati iti so vadati / cinteti.
>```mermaid
>graph LR
>A("“Puriso gacchati”")--QUS-->iti--QUM-->vadati/cinteti
>```
>He says / thinks as, “puriso gacchati” (untranslated) / “He goes” (translated).

>Ex. so “datto” iti ñāyate
>```mermaid
>graph LR
>A("“datto”")--QUS-->iti--QUM-->ñāyate
>```
>He is known as Datta.

2. The set of quoted words, viewed as a single noun, is combined with iti to form a compound.
The result is an indeclinable noun. Its case may be one of the seven cases (the Vocative is excluded) and should be inferred from the context.

>Ex. puriso gacchati iti so vadati / cinteti.
>```mermaid
>graph LR
>A("“Puriso gacchati”")--QUS-->iti--IOV-->B("vadati<br>cinteti")
>```
>He says (the words) / thinks of (the words), “puriso gacchati”, or, “He goes”.

>Ex. so “datto” iti ñāyate
>```mermaid
>graph LR
>so--AOV-->ñāyate
>A("“datto”")--QUS-->iti--IAD-->so
>```
>He, who is (named) Datta, is known.


## Sometimes, the initial part only, one word or more, of the whole speech is quoted.
In this case, the quoted portion cannot be translated. 
For example, “Puriso maggam gacchati” may be quoted as “puriso iti”.
Then it can be translated only as, “as ‘puriso’ etc.” or “the words ‘puriso’ etc.”

**Note:** the main clause outside the scope of a quoted speech can be translated separately.
Then an inserted question must follow it, after which the quoted part is given.
This is called the **Excluded Quotation** method of translation (*ākārabahikaraṇa*).

Ex. puriso gacchati iti so vadati.
= He says. [How does he say? He says] as, “puriso gacchati” (or) “He goes”.
= He says. [What does he say? He says the words] “puriso gacchati” (or) “He goes”.

In contrast, the style without an inserted question (i.e. as in the examples above
except the last) is called the **Incorporated Quotation** method (ākāra-antokaraṇa).

These two types can further be divided into two sub-types each, depending on whether the **quoted part** is translated or not.
If it remains in Pali, this may be termed the **Formally Excluded Quotation** (*saddato ākārabahikaraṇa*) method or **Formally Incorporated Quotation** (*saddato ākāra-antokaraṇa*) method.

If it is translated, this is called the **Essentially Excluded Quotation** (*atthato
ākārabahikaraṇa*) method or **Essentially Incorporated Quotation** (*atthato ākāra-antokaraṇa*) method.
