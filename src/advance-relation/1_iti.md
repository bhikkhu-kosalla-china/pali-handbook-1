# Quotations that end in - iti and types of translations
# 以*iti*结尾的引号和翻译类型

A **quotation** can be defined as *the citation of a word or words, spoken or thought of*.

**引号**可以定义为*对一个或多个单词的引用，叙述或想法*。

It can be recognized by the indeclinable *iti* added to its end.

它可以通过添加不可忽视的*iti*到句子的末尾来识别。

## It can be dealt in two ways.

## 它可以通过两种方式来处理。

1. The whole set of quoted words is viewed as a single noun and related to “iti” in Quoted Speech Relation(QUS) and “iti” itself related to a corresponding verb in Quotation Marker relation (QUM).

1. 整组被引用的单词被视为一个名词，并且与直接引语关系（QUS）中的"iti"相关，"iti"本身与引用标记关系（QUM）中的相应动词相关。

The quoted speech itself may be **translated** or
**not**.

引用的引语本身可能被**已翻译**或**未翻译**。

>Ex. puriso gacchati iti so vadati / cinteti.
>```mermaid
>graph LR
>A("“Puriso gacchati”")--QUS-->iti--QUM-->vadati/cinteti
>```
>He says / thinks as, “puriso gacchati” (untranslated) / “He goes” (translated).
>他说/认为是，"puriso gacchati"（未翻译）/"他走了"（已翻译）。

>Ex. so “datto” iti ñāyate
>```mermaid
>graph LR
>A("“datto”")--QUS-->iti--QUM-->ñāyate
>```
>He is known as Datta.
>他被称为Datta。

1. The set of quoted words, viewed as a single noun, is combined with iti to form a compound.
1. 一组被引用的单词，被视为单个名词，与iti组合形成复合词。

The result is an indeclinable noun. Its case may be one of the seven cases (the Vocative is excluded) and should be inferred from the context.
结果是一个不变名词。其情况可能是七种情况之一（不包括呼格），应从上下文中推断。

>Ex. puriso gacchati iti so vadati / cinteti.
>```mermaid
>graph LR
>A("“Puriso gacchati”")--QUS-->iti--IOV-->B("vadati<br>cinteti")
>```
>He says (the words) / thinks of (the words), “puriso gacchati”, or, “He goes”.

>Ex. so “datto” iti ñāyate
>```mermaid
>graph LR
>so--AOV-->ñāyate
>A("“datto”")--QUS-->iti--IAD-->so
>```
>He, who is (named) Datta, is known.


## Sometimes, the initial part only, one word or more, of the whole speech is quoted.
In this case, the quoted portion cannot be translated. 
For example, “Puriso maggam gacchati” may be quoted as “puriso iti”.
Then it can be translated only as, “as ‘puriso’ etc.” or “the words ‘puriso’ etc.”

**Note:** the main clause outside the scope of a quoted speech can be translated separately.
Then an inserted question must follow it, after which the quoted part is given.
This is called the **Excluded Quotation** method of translation (*ākārabahikaraṇa*).

Ex. puriso gacchati iti so vadati.
= He says. [How does he say? He says] as, “puriso gacchati” (or) “He goes”.
= He says. [What does he say? He says the words] “puriso gacchati” (or) “He goes”.

In contrast, the style without an inserted question (i.e. as in the examples above
except the last) is called the **Incorporated Quotation** method (ākāra-antokaraṇa).

These two types can further be divided into two sub-types each, depending on whether the **quoted part** is translated or not.
If it remains in Pali, this may be termed the **Formally Excluded Quotation** (*saddato ākārabahikaraṇa*) method or **Formally Incorporated Quotation** (*saddato ākāra-antokaraṇa*) method.

If it is translated, this is called the **Essentially Excluded Quotation** (*atthato
ākārabahikaraṇa*) method or **Essentially Incorporated Quotation** (*atthato ākāra-antokaraṇa*) method.
