# **35. Usage of** *yadidam* 

The phrase *yadidam* is viewed as equivalent to a combination of the  *relative* and *demonstrative* pronouns *ya* and *ima*, which can be of *nominative* case, both 
number and any gender. That is, this idiom corresponds to phrases *yo ayam, ye ime 
(Mas.) / yam idam,  yani imani (Neu.) /  ya ayam, yayo imayo (Fem.)*. But the forms of 
*ima* are taken as carrying no particular sense.
