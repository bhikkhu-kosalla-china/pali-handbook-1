# **20. Usage of** *participles / nouns* having DEF relations 
**a.** In some contexts, a participle, or a noun, which has a DEF relation to another 
verb can be upgraded to its *abstract derivative* form in *ablative* case and related to the 
same in *causal* relation. If the clause governed by the participle / noun is a *relative* or 
*absolute* one, the *active subject* or *active object* of the participle comes to have the 
*genitive case* and be the *causal possessor* of the derivative.   

 **Ex.** Puriso gacchanto (*purisassa gacchantattā*) magge bhikkhuṁ passati. 
 
 Puriso  gacchanto,--> passati (ASV) / gacchanto  --> passati 
 
 (DEF) 
 
 [Purisassa     -->     gacchantattā (POS) / gacchantattā  --> passati(CAU)] 

**Trs**. When the man goes (*because of the man’s act of going*), (he) sees the monk 
on the way. 

Pitari kā̄ḷe (*pituno kā ̄attā*) putto kā̄ḷo hoti 

 Pitari -->  kā̄ḷe (NIO)  kā̄ḷe--> hoti (DEF) 
 
 pituno --> kāḷattā (POS) kāḷattā--> hoti (CAU) 


**Trs.**  (*As* / When) (the) father is dark (*because of the father's darkness*), (the) son 
is dark. 

**b**. Sometimes, a *present participle* may imply a wish, a desire.
