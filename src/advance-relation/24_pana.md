# **24. Usage of** *ayaṁ pana* 
# 24. *ayam pana* **的用法** 


 Sometimes, the pronoun *ayaṁ* refers to a set of speech, which is already mentioned before, or, which is to be encountered later. In this case, it generally refers to the latter when it is followed by the indeclinable *pana*. On the contrary, when *ayaṁ* stands alone, it usually refers to the former.

 有时，代词*ayam*指的是套话，这在前面已经提到过，或者稍后会遇到。在这种情况下，当它后面跟着无语尾变化的*pana*时，它通常指的是后者。相反，当*ayam*独立存在时，它通常是指前者。
