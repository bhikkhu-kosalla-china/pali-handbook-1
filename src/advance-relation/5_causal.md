# **5. Causal Nouns**   


   Causal  nouns  are  those  related  to  other  words  in  causal  relation.  They  are 
usually *abstract derivatives* or *compounds* having the last member *bhava*, and they may 
have  either  *instrumental*  or  *ablative*  cases.  For  each  *causal*  noun,  there  is  always 
another  noun,  expressed  or  implied,  termed  as  a  **causal  possessor**  and  related  to  it  in 
*possessor*  relation.  #  It  **must** be of the same content as the  *abstract derivative* 
stem, or the compound member united with *bhava*, of the causal noun. # 

 A  *causal  possessor*  is  generally  the  *active*  subject  /  object  of  the  sentence  in 
which its causal noun is mentioned. (When the *double *active* subject* / *object* relation is 
used,  the  *primary*  subject  /  object  should  be  chosen  as  the  **causal*  possessor*.)  In  such 
cases,  causal  possessors  are  usually  not  expressed  ---  to  be  understood  only  from  the 
context.  

Ex. Darako (*darakassa*) chatatta / chatabhavato bhubjati = the child eats on     account of (the child’s, i.e. his) state of being the one who is hungry.  
  Darako  --> bhubjati (ASV)   darakassa   -->    chatatta / chatabhavato (POS)  chatatta  / chatabhavato    -->     bhubjati (CAU) 
  
   However, there are cases where a causal possessor is different in content from the 
*active* subject / object of a given sentence. In this case, it is normally expressed. 

 Ex. Darakassa chatatta mata pacati = mother cooks on account of the child’s  state of being the one who is hungry.  
      Darakassa  --> chatatta (POS) chatatta  --> pacati (CAU)  mata  -->  pacati (ASV) 
      
 Sometimes, there is another noun, or pronoun, which is related not to the whole 
*causal* noun, but only to its *abstract derivative* stem, or the first compound member. It 
is also normally expressed and termed an **independent possessor**. 

Ex. Puriso gamam (*gamassa*) coranam bhumitaya na gacchati = The man does not 
go to the village on account of its (i.e. of the village) state of being the thieves’ 
ground. 

gamassa  -->  bhumitaya (POS)  coranam   -->  bhumi(taya) (POS)  

In the example above, the implied *gamassa* is the *causal possessor* while  
coranam,  which  is  related  to  the  *abstract  derivative*  stem  *bhumi*,  is  the  *independent 
possessor*.  

Sometimes, a causal noun is neither an *abstract* derivative nor a compound with 
*bhava*. In this case, it is treated as if it were either, i.e. an *abstract* derivative, or, for that 
matter,  a  compound  with  *bhava*;  its  *causal*  possessor  and  its  sense  also  are  defined 
accordingly. Such a *causal* noun is called an  **essentially abstractive** (*bhavappadhana*) 
noun or an **elided-abstractive** (*bhavalopa*) noun. 

Ex. Puriso bhumiyam (*purisassa*) sayanato dukkham papunati = the man reaches 
(i.e. gets) suffering on account of (*the man’s, i.e. his*) state of the one who sleeps 
on the ground. 

In the example above, the causal noun *sayanato* is equivalent to the compound  *sayanabhàvato*,  of  which  the  initial  part  *sayana*  is  taken  to  be  of  **subjective**  suffixal 
case since its content is the same as that of *purisa*.   

  In *comment units*, certain words belonging to the *commented units* are sometimes 
transformed into *causal nouns*. Then it is expected to recognize their *causal possessors* 
even though not expressed. There are some tips for this. 

 a. When a *past participle* used as an *active / passive* verb is converted into  a *causal* noun, its *active* subject or object respectively becomes the *causal possessor*. 

Ex.  *Puriso gamam gato = The man goes to the village. 
 Purisassa gatatta ... = Because of the man’s state of being the one who goes ...    
        *Purisena kammam katam = The work is done by the man. 
        
 Kammassa katatta ... = Because of the work’s state of being the one which is  done ...

 b.  When the first word of the *nominal identity* relation, or the *primary*  
subject  of  the  *double  active  subject*  relation,  becomes  a  *causal*  noun,  its  *causal 
possessor* would be its  **inserted** synonym whereas, if the second one or the  *secondary* 
subject is transformed, the first one or the  *primary* subject respectively would come to 
possess it. 

Ex. Bhupala **tissadattaiccadayo** (honti) nama = the Land Protectors are named  *Tissa, Datta*,etc.  
  Rajanam Bhupalataya ... = because of the kings’ state of being the Land  Protectors..

Bhupalanam **tissadatta**iccadibhavato ... = because of the Land Protectors’  state of being named *Tissa, Datta*,etc... 

 c. When an *identical* adjective becomes a *causal* noun, the noun modified  by it is the  *causal possessor*, whereas, when  the qualified part itself is changed into a 
*causal* form, its **inserted** synonym comes to possess it. 

  Ex. Mahanto buddho ... = the great Buddha    
   buddhassa mahantatta ... = on account of the Buddha’s greatness ...   
   
   
   
     bhagavato buddhataya ... = on account of the Glorious one’s buddhahood ...
