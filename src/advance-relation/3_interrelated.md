# 3. Interrelated Translations  
 It is the method in which a foregoing sentence is translated first; the following 
one is dealt with later and returning to the first one again. Its purpose is to clarify the 
logical structure of given context. 

 It can be used with five pairs of **thematic units**.  
- a. Unit of Effect *followed by* Unit of Cause  
- b. Unit of Conclusion *followed by* Unit of Premise     
- c. Unit of Doubtful Content *followed by* Unit of Confirming Content  
 - d. Unit of Definite Content *followed by* Unit of Indefinite Content  
 - e. Unit of Compared Object *followed by* Unit of Standard of Comparison 
  
 Of  them,  the  interrelated  translation  of  *Unit  of  Doubtful  Content  /  Unit  of 
Confirmation* is the most difficult and the least helpful. Therefore it would be put aside 
and others are to be imparted.

  - **Ex**. Dhumo girismim hoti. Tattha hi aggi atthi.   
  - **Trs**. (Simple) There is smoke on the mountain, because there is fire there . 
  
   (Interrelated) There is smoke on the mountain. (Why is there smoke on             the mountain?) Since there is fire there, there is smoke on the mountain.
