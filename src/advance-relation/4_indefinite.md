# **4. Indefinite / Definite** Translations  
If a sentence is to be translated using Nominal Identity (Ordinary / 
Denominative)  relation,  Double  Active  Subject  (Ordinary  /  Denominative),  Double 
Active  Object  or  Double  Inactive  Object  relation,  it  can  be  divided  into  two  separate 
sentences.

  In  the  first  sentence,  a  relative  pronoun  would  be  combined  with  the  first  noun 
(with the *nominative* case) in the Nominal Identity relation, and with Primary Subjects 
or  Objects  in  others.  Hence,  it  is  called  an  **indefinite**  sentence.  In  the  second  one,  a 
Denominative pronoun would be brought together with the second noun (*the 
*nominative*  case*)  in  the  Nominal  Identity  relation,  and  with  Secondary  Subjects  or 
Objects in others. Hence, it is called a **definite** sentence.   
   **Ex**. Tassa pita acariyo [His father (is / was) a teacher. pita --> acariyo (NIO)] 
= Yo tassa pita, so acariyo [The one who (is / was) his father, he is / was a teacher] 

*Samano Tisso nama [The monk (is / was) Tissa by name. Samano   -->  Tisso (NID)] = Yo samano, so Tisso nama. [ The one who (is / was) the monk, he is / was Tissa by  name] 

*Tassa pita acariyo hoti. [His father becomes a teacher. pita   -->   hoti (DASO-P) 

 acariyo   -->    hoti (DASO-S)] 
= Yo tassa pita, so acariyo hoti [The one who is his father, he becomes a teacher] 
*Samano Tisso nama ahosi [The monk was Tissa by name. 
Samano  -->  ahosi (DASD-P)  Tisso -->  ahosi (DASD-S)] 
                                                                                                                                                                    
   
   
 
=  Yo  samano,  so  Tisso  nama  ahosi.  [The  one  who  was  the  monk,  he  was  Tissa  by 
name]

 *Samanero bhikkhu kato [The novice is made a monk]  
 
 Samanero --> kato (DAO-P) 
 bhikkhu  -->  kato (DAO-S) 
 
 = Yo samanero, so bhikkhu kato [The one who is a novice, he is made a monk.] 

*Acariyo samaneram bhikkhum karoti. [The teacher makes the novice a monk] 

 samaneram   --> karoti (DIO-P)   bhikkhum   -->   karoti (DIO-S) 
 
 =  Acariyo yo samanero, tam bhikkhum karoti. [The one who is the novice, the teacher 
makes him a monk.  
Acariyo     -->    karoti (ASV) / tam --> karoti (DIO-P) / bhikkhum    -->     karoti (DIO-S)
