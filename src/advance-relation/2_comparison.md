# 2. Expressions of Comparison
The indeclinables *viya, iva, yathā*, etc. are used to give comparisons in a sentence, which may be termed a *comparison sentence*.
It can be separated into two parts, one of the compared object (*upameyya*) and the other of the standard of comparison (*upamāna*).

>|**Ex**|Samaṇo ākāse gacchati narā viya/iva/yathā bhūmiyaṃ|Samaṇo ākāse gacchati / narā bhūmiyaṃ (*gacchanti*) viya / iva / yathā|
>|-|-|-|
>|**Trs**|The monk goes in the sky as people (go) on the ground.|The monk goes in the sky. (Like whom?) Just as people (go) on the ground.|
>Two parts of a comparison sentence can be divided in the translation by an inserted question.
It is called **Excluded Comparison** method.
(When no question is inserted, it is called **Incorporated Comparison** method)

The phrase yatha …tatha can be used to form a comparison sentence.

>- Ex. Yatha nara bhumiyam gacchanti, tatha samano akase gacchati.
>- Trs. Just as people go on the ground, so also the monk goes in the sky.

Note: when *yathā … tathā* is used not to denote a comparison, the verb which *tathā* (meaning “in that way”) modifies must be changed into a *participle* and related in **DEF** relation to the verb of the *yathā* (meaning “in which way”) sentence.
The word *yathā* must be related to that participle in Adverbial relation.



>**Ex**. yathā (mayi karonte) buddho anujānissati, tathā karissāmi.
