# **26. Usage of** double negatives 
   
A double negative in Pali is equivalent to an affirmative. But it is usually tran-
slated in two different ways. 

**Ex**. Raja silavanto na na hoti. 

**Trs**. The king is one who has virtue. (Or) it is not true that (= one na) the king is  not one who has virtue; the king is really one who has virtue.
