# 笼统-具体
E.g. 例如：
- A. The couple came to town.这对夫妇进城了
- B. Just (**T.M**) as birds come to a tree full of fruits for a good meal, they moved to town hoping for an easy and happy life.
- 就(**T. M**)像鸟儿为了享用美味而来到一棵挂满果实的树一样，他们向往着轻松快乐的生活而搬到城里。

    (**T.M**) = " to explain OR to make lucid"
    (**T. M**)=“解释或使清楚”
* The following unit B is a Unit of Illuminated Content with reference to A, for it is an explanation of how that couple moved to town.
* 以下单元B是参照A的照明内容单元，因为它解释了这对夫妇是如何搬到镇上的

    Accordingly, A is termed a Unit of Vague Content with reference to B.
    因此，A被称为参照B的模糊内容单元。

    Note: a simply exhaustive account is termed a Unit of Elaborated Content whereas the one given using similes or reasoning is called a Unit of Illuminated Content.
    注：简单详尽的叙述称为详述内容的单元，而使用明喻或推理的叙述称为阐明内容的单元。
