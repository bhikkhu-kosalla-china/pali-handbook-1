# 句子关系
## **简介**<br>**Introduction**
通常定义两种关系来分析给定的巴利语文本，即*词对词*关系和*句对句*关系。
>There are two kinds of relations usually defined to analyze given Pali text, namely, *word-to-word* relations and *sentence-to-sentence* ones.

>译者注：该关系连词通常是出现在一个句子的第二个位置上

前者用于获取句子的句法意义，已在“基础/高级关系语法(Basic / Advanced Relational Grammar)”中讨论过。
>The former is used to get the syntactic sense of a sentence and has been discussed in *Basic / Advanced Relational Grammar*.

后者用于准确描述一段、一章甚至一卷句子之间的逻辑关系。
>The latter is used to get the accurate picture of logical relations among sentences of a paragraph, a chapter or even a volume.

本主题是对“句对句”关系的介绍。
>This topic is an introduction to *sentence-to-sentence* relations.

## *Vākya*<br>**主题单元**<br>**Thematic Unit**
巴利语术语“vākya”字面意思是“一个句子”，即独立的一组单词集合，其中可以在不超出该集合的情况下，正确地定义句法上的单词对单词的关系。
>The Pali term *vākya* literally means "a sentence", i.e., a self-contained set of words, in which syntactic word-to-word relations can be properly defined without going out of the set.

然而，它在这里指的是内容或主题的独立单元，因此使用**主题单元**这个术语。
>However, it means here an independent unit of content or subject matter, hence the term **thematic unit**.

**最小的主题单元**是一个**句子**，它们中的每一个都可以组合成更大的主题单元，它们的范围从**两个或两个以上的句子**到**整段或一章**，或者**甚至整卷**不等。
>The **smallest thematic unit** is a **sentence** and each of them may combine to form larger ones --- with their extents ranging from **two or more sentences** up to **a whole paragraph or chapter**, or **even a whole volume**.

## *Vākyajotaka*<br>**主题标识**<br>**Thematic Markers**

许多主题单元用一些不变词来标记，即*hi*、*ca*或*pana*。
>Many thematic units are marked by certain indeclinables, namely, *hi, ca,* or *pana*.

它们通常**紧跟**其所在句子的**第一个单词**的后面。
>They are usually placed **immediately after** the **initial words** of their respective sentences.

从理论上讲，它们与英语连词相似， 据说它们能指明*主题单元*之间的句法关系。
>In theory, they are similar to English conjunctions --- they are said to illuminate the thematic relations among *thematic units*.

然而，在实践中，它们中的每一个都被用来表示几乎所有可能的关系；（如此灵活的）超负荷使用，(使得主题标记)本身无法成为(分析句法关系的)凭据。
>In practice, however, each of them is used to indicate almost all relations possible; it is almost impossible to rely on them when they are so overloaded.

(这也导致)在实践中(与理论上)恰恰相反，
>The actual process is rather the reverse.

主题标记只是一个信号，表明有必要分析其**主**单元与**前一个**单元的句法关系。
>A thematic marker is only a signal that indicates the necessity to analyze the thematic relation of its HOST unit to the PREVIOUS one.

在完成分析并找出关系后，利用这种关系对标记本身进行合理的翻译。
>After the analysis has been finished and the relation found out, that relation is used to make a reasonable translation of the marker itself.

  
## **Essential Content** (*Piṇḍattha*)
The term **essential content** is used in contrast with the *literal* content.

For example, a simple sentence counting the Triple Gems as Buddha, Dhamma and Saṅgha is **literally different** from a whole chapter explaining them in detail one by one; but they are **essentially the same** in content. Why? Because the subject matter is the same, i.e., the Triple Gems.

The **essential content** of a thematic unit is related to that of its **previous** or **following one** in one of following three ways:
- a. Identity
- b. Cause / effect (premise / conclusion)
- c. ordinary connection.

## **Types of Thematic Units**
The type of a given **thematic unit** is defined in reference to its preceding and following ones. For instance, if a unit is an **elaboration** of the previous one but serves as one of **partial content** to the following one, it is termed as the unit of both elaboration and **partial content**. Accordingly, types of thematic units are usually given in pairs; in each pair, each member has its type defined in reference to another.

Depending on the relation of their **essential contents**, they are divided into three classes.
