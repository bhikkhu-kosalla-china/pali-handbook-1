# **(a)Relative Clause** 

(1) There must be a present participle governing the clause.
 (2) It must be in Active or Passive voice and follow the case, gender and 
number of its Active subject or object. 

(3)The case of the Active subject or object depends on its relation to some word 
in the main clause. 

(4) Every Relative Clause can have two different interpretations and, 
accordingly, the participle governing it can have two different relations. 

 They are as follows---    
- a.It is related to the main verb in Definitive Relation (DEF)1,OR, 
                                                 
 - b.It is related to its Active subject or object in Identical Adjective 
Relation (IAD). 

(5)If the participle is in Genitive case, it is sometimes implied that the  action expressed by the main verb is carried out in spite of the situation  expressed by the Defining Relative Clause. 

 E.g. puriso gacchanto ratanaṃ passati = (As / While / When)   (the) man is 
going / goes, (he) sees the jewel.

puriso  -->  gacchanto (ASV) / puriso     -->   passati (ASV) gacchanto       -->      passati (DEF)   / ratanaṃ      -->         passati (IOV) (OR) The man who goes (is going) sees the jewel. 

gacchanto   --> puriso (IAD) / puriso     -->     passati (ASV)  ratanaṃ    -->             passati (IOV) 
* purisaṃ gacchantaṃ bhikkhu passati = (while/As/When) (the) man goes (is  going), (the/a) monk sees (him).
  
  
   purisaṃ     -->   gacchantaṃ (ASV) / purisaṃ      -->   passati (IOV) gacchantaṃ    -->      passati (DEF) / bhikkhu      -->      passati (ASV) (OR)= The monk sees the man who goes/ is going. 

   gacchantaṃ  --> purisam (IAD) purisaṃ      -->     passati (IOV) bhikkhu    -->       passati (ASV) 
* purisassa passantassa dhanaṃ corā haranti = (Even while / Even as) the man  sees (is looking on), thieves carried (his) property (away). 
  
   purisassa --> passantassa (ASV) / purisassa --> dhanaṃ (POS) dhanaṃ --> haranti (IOV) /  corā  --> haranti (ASV) (OR) = Thieves carried away the property of the man who sees (is looking on). 
(Note: in this translation, the sense "in spite of" is left out) 

passantassa  --> purisassa (IAD) / purisassa  -->dhanaṃ (POS) dhanaṃ --> haranti (IOV) /  corā  --> haranti (ASV)
