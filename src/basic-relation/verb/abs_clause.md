 **(b) Absolute Clause** 

(1) There must be a **participle** (past, present or future), OR an ordinary noun, 
governing the clause. 

(2) It must be in **genitive** or **locative** case and must be related to the main verb 
in Definitive Relation (DEF). 

(3) If it is a participle --- 
 - It must be in Active or Passive voice and must follow the **gender** and      
   **number** of its Active subject or Active object. 
- Its Active subject or Active object must follow its **case** and must NOT    
    have any relation to any **word** in the **main clause**.
 OR if it is an ordinary noun ---
     
 - It must have a **complement** --- **another** noun of the same case, and 
probably the same gender and number --- related to it in Nominal Identity 
(Ordinary / Denominative) relation. 

- Its **complement** must NOT have any relation to any **word** in the **main 
clause**. 

 (4) When the participle, or the noun, governing the clause is in genitive 
case, it may have the same implied sense as the Relative clause 
participle.

 E.g. Purise gāmaṃ gacchante / gate dārako sayati = (As / When / While ) (the)  man goes / has gone (to) the village, the child sleeps. 
 
 Purise      -->       gacchante / gate (ASV)  gāmaṃ        -->    gacchante / gate (IOV) gacchante / gate      -->    sayati (DEF) dārako       -->     sayati (ASV) 
 
  Pitari kā ̄e putto kā̄ḷo hoti =  (As / When) (the) father is dark, (the) son is dark. 
  
  Pitari -->  kā̄ḷe (NIO)  kā̄ḷe --> hoti (DEF) putto  --> hoti (DASO - P) kā̄ḷo --> hoti (DASO -  S) 
  
   dārakassa rodantassa asso dhāvati = (Even as / Even while) (the) child is  crying, the horse runs (away).
   
   dārakassa        -->      rodantassa (ASV) rodantassa        -->     dhāvati (DEF) asso              -->     dhāvati (ASV)
