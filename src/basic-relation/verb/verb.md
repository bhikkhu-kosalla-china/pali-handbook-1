# 动词关系语法
# **Causative Verbs** 

Causative verbs are viewed as compound verbs, i.e., they are seen as 
combinations of the actions represented by roots and those by the causal 
suffixes (the whole verbs). Accordingly, components of a causative verb have 
different sets of subjects and objects. 

因果动词被视为复合动词，即它们被视为由词根及因果后缀（整个动词）代表的行动的组合。因此，因果动词的组成部分具有不同的主语和宾语组合。

They can be enumerated as follows: 
1.  causal subject, 
2. causal object, 
3. Radial subject, 
4. Radial object. 

它们可以枚举如下：
1.因果主要，

2.因果宾语，

3.Radial subject，

4.Radial object。
   
It should be noted here that the Causal Object and the Radial Subject are  represented by the same word. Causative verbs can also be classified in three 
voices---Active, passive and Absolute. 

这里应该注意的是，因果主语和Radial Subject由同一个词表示。因果动词也可以分为三种语态---主动，被动和绝对。
