# **Gerunds** 
 They are also indeclinable verbal derivatives of Absolute voice. They can 
have two senses; (a) real or figurative priority in time (b) causality. When used 
in the first sense, they have the same subject as the verbs qualified by them and 
are related to them in Adverbial Relation (ADV). 

 However, when the second sense is to be understood, they have subjects 
different from those of the verbs they qualify and related to them in causality 
Relation (CAU). 

**E.g**.  * So pacitvā bhuñjati = He cooks and eats. (**real priority in time**)

 So        -->     (pacitvā)         -->    bhuñjati (ASV)
 
  pacitvā      -->       bhuñjati (ADV) 
  * So mukhaṃ vivaritvā sayati = He opens the mouth and sleeps, i.e., sleeps with 
  
      So      -->      (vivaritvā)          -->      sayati (ASV)   the open mouth. 
      
      mukhaṃ        -->       vivaritvā (IOV)        (**figurative priority in time**) 
      
      vivaritvā        -->        sayati (ADV)
      
       * tassa sīhaṃ disvā bhayaṃ hoti = His fear arises because of seeing the lion.  
(**Causality**) 

tassa      -->      bhayaṃ (POS) 

tassa --> disvā (ISV)  
 bhayaṃ     -->     hoti (ASV) 
 
 sīhaṃ        -->      disvā (IOV) 
 
 disvā         -->     hoti (CAU) 

*" **Hutvā**" with **Double Inactive Subject** (*Ordinary*) relation [DISO ] 

This relation is used with an **inserted** or **expressed** *hutvā* ---

 a. to indicate a certain **adverbial sense** OR 

 b. to indicate a complete change of a certain state into another OR 
 
 c. both. 

E.g.   Puriso sāmanero (hutvā) vasati. [ *hutvā* may be inserted or expressed.] 

 = He, having been a novice, stays. 
 
  [= He stays as a novice (**adverbially**) OR He becomes a novice and stays 
(**change of state**) OR He stays after becoming a novice (**both**)] 

 Puriso  vasati (ASV) Puriso  hutvā (DISO-P) 
 
  sāmanero   hutvā (DISO-S) 


In the sentence above, *puriso* is the **primary inactive subject** and 
*sāmanero* the **secondary inactive subject** of *hutvā*. *Puriso* is in 
**nominative** case, **singular** number only because it is the **active subject** 
of the main verb *vasati*; *sāmanero* follows *puriso* in case, gender and 
number because they are identical in content. As regards *hutvā*, they are 
only **inactive subjects**.  

  E.g. Purisena sāmanerena (hutvā) bhattaṃ bhuñjīyate. 
  
   = Food is eaten by him, having been a novice [ = Food is eaten by him as 
a novice (**adverbially**) OR Food is eaten by him becoming a novice (**change 
of state**) OR Food is eaten by him after becoming  a novice (**both**)] 

 Purisena --> bhuñjīyate (ISV) Purisena-->  hutvā (DSO-P) 

bhattaṃ  --> bhuñjīyate  (AOV) sāmanerena -->  hutvā (DSO-S)

 Here also, *purisena* is the **primary inactive subject** and 
*sāmanerena*, the **secondary inactive subject** of *hutvā*. *Purisena* is in 
**instrumental** case because it is the **inactive subject** of the main verb 
*bhuñjīyate*; *sāmanerena* follows *purisena* in case, gender and number 
because they are identical in content. As regards *hutvā*, they are only 
**inactive subjects**.  

**Exception**: Purisena sāmanero (hutvā) bhattaṃ bhuñjīyate. 

 Here *sāmanero*, the **secondary inactive** subject, is in **nominative** case  but the relations and the translation is the same as above. Such usage is 
only occasional in Pali literature. 

*" **Hutvā**" with **Double Inactive Subject** (*Denominative*) relation [DISD]  

  The only difference of this relation from the one above is the usage of the 
indeclinable *nāma*. 

 E.g. Puriso datto nāma (hutvā) vasati. = He, having been *datta* by name, stays. 

[= He stays with the name *datta* ] 
  
   Puriso --> vasati (ASV) Puriso --> hutvā (DISD-P)   
   
  datto  --> hutvā (DISD-S)
  
   E.g. Purisena dattena nāma (hutvā) rājā hatā. = The king was killed by the man,  having been *datta* by name. [= The king was killed by the man with the 
name *datta*]
