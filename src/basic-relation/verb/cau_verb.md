Causative Verbs 
Causative verbs are viewed as compound verbs,
i.e., they are seen as combinations of the actions represented by roots and those by the causal suffixes (the whole verbs). 
Accordingly, components of a causative verb have different sets of subjects and objects.
They can be enumerated as follows:
1. causal subject, 
2. causal object,
3. Radial subject,
4. Radial object. 

It should be noted here that the Causal Object and the Radial Subject are represented by the same word.
Causative verbs can also be classified in three voices---Active, passive and Absolute.
