# **Causative Verbs** 

Causative verbs are viewed as compound verbs,
i.e., they are seen as combinations of the actions represented by roots and those by the causal suffixes (the whole verbs). 

因果动词被视为复合动词，也就是说，它们被视为由词根表示的动作和由因果后缀（整个动词）表示的动作的组合。

Accordingly, components of a causative verb have different sets of subjects and objects.
They can be enumerated as follows:
1. causal subject, 
2. causal object,
3. Radial subject,
4. Radial object. 

因此，因果动词的组成部分具有不同的主语和宾语组合。

可以按如下方式枚举它们：

1. 因果主语，

2. 因果宾语，

3. Radial主语，

4. Radial宾语。
 
It should be noted here that the Causal Object and the Radial Subject are represented by the same word.
Causative verbs can also be classified in three voices---Active, passive and Absolute. 
这里应该注意的是，因果宾语和Radial Subject由同一个词表示。因果动词也可以分为三种语态---主动，被动和绝对。
