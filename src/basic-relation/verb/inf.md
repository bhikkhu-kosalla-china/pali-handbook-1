# **Infinitives** 
 Infinitives are considered as indeclinable verbal derivatives of Absolute 
voice. They are related to the verb they qualify in Purposive Relation (PUR) and 
generally have the same subject as the verb they qualify. 

 However, they may serve as Active subjects or objects of the verbs 
qualified by them when these verbs have no separate Active subject or object.
When used in this way, infinitives are viewed as third person nouns in nomi-
native case and singular number, and the main verb must agree with it.  

**E.g.**, So bhuñjituṃ pacati = He cooks to eat. 

So      -->      bhuñjituṃ       -->      pacati (**ASV**) 

 bhuñjituṃ       -->      pacati (PUR) 
 
 phalaṃ dātuṃ kappati = (it) is possible to give (a / the) fruit. 
 
  phalaṃ   -->    dātuṃ (IOV)
  
   dātuṃ  --> kappati (PUR / ASV) 
   
   phalaṃ khādituṃ labbhate = (it) is possible to eat (a / the ) fruit. 
   
   phalaṃ  -->  khādituṃ(IOV) 
   
   khādituṃ --> labbhate (AOV)
