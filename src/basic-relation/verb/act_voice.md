# 主动语态
 # **A. Active Voice** 

 Here the causal subject is put in nominative case, the causal object 
(Radial subject) in Accusative or Instrumental and the Radial Object in 
Accusative.

 puriso dārakaṃ / dārakena gāmaṃ gamayati = (The) man makes (the) child go    to (the) village.
 
 gamayati = √gam + aya + ti 

√gam = to go, gamayati = make (sb / sth) go 

Therefore the word-relations in the sentence above are: 

puriso  -->  gamayati (ASV) 

dārakaṃ (dārakena)      -->        gamayati (IOV)            
 -->√ gam [subject-verb relation1 (SV)
]                    
gāmaṃ      -->    √ gam [object-verb relation2 (OV)] 

**Note**: A root in itself is neither Active nor Passive, so subjects and objects 
related to it will have simple S.V or O.V relations.
