# **Absolute Voice** 
 Here the causal subject is in Instrumental case, causal object (Radial 
subject) in Instrumental or Accusative case and Radial object in Accusative 
case.

 E.g. purisena dārakaṃ / dārakena gāmaṃ   gamāpīyati = (the) child is caused                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            by (the) man to go (to) the village
 
  purisena    -->     gamāpīyati (ISV) 
   dārakaṃ / dārakena   -->  gamāpīyati(IOV)        -->       √ gam (SV)                    
gāmaṃ   -->   √ gam (OV) 

 **Identical Adjective relation1 (IAD)** 

 Here a noun in adjectival use is related to a noun it modifies. The 
adjective must follow the case of the substantive but may differ in gender and 
number.

 mahatā purisena =...with (a/ the) great man 
 
 mahatā --> purisena (IAD) 
 
 nandā nāma saro = (the) lake Nandā by name--- 
 
 nandā  --> saro (IAD)
 
  vīsati purisā = twenty men--- 
  
  vīsati       -->       purisā (IAD) 


**Note**: mark the difference of gender in the second example and that of both 
gender and number in the last.
