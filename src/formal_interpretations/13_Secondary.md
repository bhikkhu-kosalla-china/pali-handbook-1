**Secondary Derivatives as Commented Units** 
 - 1. When a *secondary derivative* is commented --- 
 
 a. with a *primary derivative* which has the *verbal suffixal case*, especially with those having the suffix *ana* **OR**, 
 b. with its *secondary* stem compounded with *bhāva*, or, *ākāra*, 
 the *abstract derivative* type is usually indicated. 
 Ex. **dāyakatā**ti dānaṃ / dāyakabhāvo / dāyakakāro 
 - 2. If a *secondary derivative* is commented using words having the sense of **similarity** 
or **comparison**, such as *sarikkhaka*, *sadisa*, *sama*, *viya*, *iva*, etc., the comparative type is 
usually indicated.

 Ex. **sīho**ti sīhasadiso / sīhena samo / sīho viya 
 
 - 3. The Secondary Derivatives of *possessive* type and the other three of the *miscellaneous* type --- *origination (bhava)*, *birth (jāta)*, and *attachment (niyutta)* --- are viewed as 
equivalents. Accordingly, an indication of anyone of them implies others. 

 Ex. rājagahaṃ assa atthi (rājagahe bhavo, rājagahe jato, rājagahe niyutto) iti **rājagahako**.
