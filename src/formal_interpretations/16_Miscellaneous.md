**Miscellaneous** 
1. When a *comment unit* has words having the possessive sense --- *samannāgata, 
sampuṇṇa, paripuṇṇa, sampanna*, etc. --- it usually indicates the *commented unit* as being 
a Primary Derivative of *subjective suffixal* case, a *Relative* Compound, or a Secondary De-
rivative of *possessive* type. 

 Ex. (Primary Derivative of subjective suffixal case) **dāyako**ti dānena samannāgato. 
 (Relative Compound) **mahādhano**ti mahantena dhanena sampuṇṇo. 
 (Possessive Derivative) **dhanavato**ti dhanena sampannassa. 
2. Three grammatical entities given above --- the Primary Derivative of *subjective suf-
fixal* case, the *Relative* Compound, the Secondary Derivative of *possessive* type--- are 
viewed as essentially equivalent. Accordingly, anyone of them may be used to indicate 
others. 

 - a. Commented unit indicated as a *Primary* Derivative of *subjective *suffixal case** 
 Ex. **dāyako**ti dinnacīvaro (puriso) [comment unit as *relative compound*] 
 **dāyako**ti dānavanto [comment unit as *possessive derivative*] 
 - b. Commented unit indicated as a *Relative* Compound 
 
 Ex. **mahādhano**ti dhanavanto [comment unit as *possessive derivative*] 
 **laddhadhano**ti dhanaṃ labhanto [comment unit as *primary derivative of subjective suffixal case*]

 - c. Commented unit indicated as a *Possessive* Derivative 
 Ex. **dhanavā**ti bahudhano [comment unit as *relative compound*] 
 **gatimanto**ti gacchanto [comment unit as *primary derivative of subjective suffixal case*] 
 
3. When a verbal stem, either of a conjugated verb or of a *primary derivative*, is com-
mented using a noun combined with a verbal form derived from the root √ kar, it is meant 
to be a suggestion of a *denominative* verb or derivative. 
 Ex. **saddāyatī**ti saddaṃ karoti. **saddāyanto**ti saddaṃ karonto.
4. Sometimes, the sense of a verbal stem or of a root is commented using verbal 
forms derived from the roots *√ hū, √ bhū, or √ kar*. 
 Ex. **sucanto**ti sucati parisuddho bhavati. **hato**ti hanati maranaṃ karoti.
