# **C.2 Nominal Indications** 

 Here,  the  term  "nominal"  literally  means  "concerned  with  nouns",  yet  all  nouns, 
pronouns and numerals should be placed in its scope. On the other hand, the indications of 
compounds  (*samāsa*),  Primary  Derivatives  (*kita*)  and  Secondary  Derivatives  (*taddhita*) 
will be treated separately.   

 - **a. Nominal-Stem indication** (*nāmaliṅgapadasaṃvaṇṇanā*) 
  
   Ex. **Assā**ti tassa.. 
 
    The phrase "tassa" indicates that the stem of *assa* is ta (not *ima*) 
 - **b. Nominal-Stem Sense indication** (*nāmaliṅgatthasaṃvaṇṇanā*) 

    Ex. **Assā**ti dhammassa 
       The phrase "dhammassa" indicates that the stem ta or *ima* of *assa*  has  (i.e. 
refers to) the sense "dhamma". 

 - **c. Nominal-Case indication** (*vibhattipadasaṃvaṇṇanā*) 

     Ex. **Purisānan**ti catutthī(bahu)vacanaṃ / sampadāna(bahu)vacanaṃ  
     
     The phrase " catutthī(bahu)vacanaṃ" or " sampadāna(bahu)vacanaṃ" indi-
cates that the word *purisānaṃ* has the Dative case (and plural number).

 - **d. Nominal-Case Sense indication** (*vibhatyatthasaṃvaṇṇanā*) 
  
   Ex. **ekaṃ samayan**ti ekasmiṃ samaye. 
   
   The phrase "**ekasmiṃ samaye**" indicates that the Accusative cases of *ekaṃ* and *samayaṃ* have the Locative sense. 
   
    Ex. **Buddhan**ti kammatthaniddeso.
    
     The phrase "kammatthaniddeso" indicates that the Accusative case of *bud-
dhaṃ* has the Objective sense.
