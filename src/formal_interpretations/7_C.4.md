# **C. 4 Primary Derivative indications** 

The term "primary derivative" includes in its scope Present, Past and Future Partici-
ples, Infinitives, Gerunds, and other noun stems that result when roots and appropriate suf-
fixes are combined. Depending on their respective methods of formation, they may be ei-
ther combinations of roots and suffixes, or those of verbal stems and suffixes. 

 Present Participle --> verbal stem + suffix 
 Past Participle --> root / verbal stem + suffix 
 Future Participle --> root / verbal stem + suffix Infinitive --> root / verbal stem + suffix 
 Gerund --> root / verbal stem + suffix Others --> root + suffix 
 
 If a part or the whole of a commented unit is a Primary Derivative, its comment unit 
would be concerned with its root (if it is formed by adding a suffix to a root), or its verbal stem (if formed by adding a suffix to a verbal stem), the sense of either of them, the suffix or its sense. The terms root and verbal stem here would be labelled with the epithet primary to differentiate them from those of conjugated verbs, and the term suffix also, to make it different from that of the secondary derivative.
