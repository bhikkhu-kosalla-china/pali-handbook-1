**C. 7 Prefix indications** 

There are twenty prefixes used in Pali. They are termed *upasagga* in Sanskrit 
and in Pali commentarial literature. In Pali grammatical works, however, they are 
called *upasāra*. They are given here with their Sanskrit counterparts also in brackets 
wherever they are not identical with the corresponding Pali forms.

 Ati, Adhi, Anu, Apa, Api, Abhi, Ava, Ā, U (**Ut**)2, Upa, O3, Du (**Duḥ**)4, Ni (**Ni 
/ Nir**)5, Pa (**Pra**), Pati (**Prati**), Parā, Pari, Vi, Saṃ, Su. 

A prefix may be used, to *modify* or to *reverse* the sense of the verb, or the 
noun, with which it is combined. Otherwise, it is a mere element that carries no par-
ticular sense. 

**Ex**. √ car - "to go, to move" ati √ car - "to go beyond, to overtake, to invade" (*ati as modifier*) 
 √ ji - "to win, to conquer" parā √ ji - "to lose, to be defeated" (*parā as 
reverser*) 

 √ car - "to practise, to perform" ā√ car - the same (ā as a mere element) 

**a. Prefix-Defining indication** (*upasāraliṅgapadasaṃvaṇṇanā*) 
 **Ex. abhī**ti upasaggo The phrase *upasaggo* indicates that *abhi* is a prefix. 

**b. Prefix-sense indication** (*upasāraliṅgatthasaṃvaṇṇanā*) 
 
 **Ex**. āgantvā ramanaṃ **ārammanaṃ**. 

The phrase *āgantvā* indicates that *ā* of *ārammanaṃ* is a prefix having the 
sense, " having come".




2 Ut is changed into Ud when followed by vowels or soft consonants. 

3 Ava is used instead of O in Sanskrit.

 4 Duh is changed into Dur, Dus, Duw, Dus, or Du, owing to Sandhi. 
 
 5 Ni and Nir have different senses in Sankrit. But they are represented in Pali by the single form Ni only.
