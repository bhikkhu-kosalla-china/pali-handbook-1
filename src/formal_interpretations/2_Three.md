# **B.Three Types of Comments**
 1. **Iti** Comment (*Ulliṅga*)  
 1. **Non-iti** Comment (*Vutti*)  
 1. **Relational** Comment (*Sambandha*)  
**Examples** 
   
    **1. --Poso**ti Puriso:- In this sentence, the commented unit *poso* is explained as having the sense, "man". It is termed as **iti comment** due to the use of the indeclinable iti. 
   
    **2. --Poso** Puriso:- Here the explanation is the same, but *iti* is not used; therefore, it is la-
belled **non-iti comment**.  
    
    **3**.  --Abhivādiya bhāsissaṃ  abhidhammatthasaṅgahaṃ. (*Commented unit*)  
     
    **abhidhammatthasaṅgahaṃ bhāsissanti** sambandho. (*Comment unit*)
    
     The phrase *abhidhamma* --- *sambandho* implies that *abhidhammattha- saṅgahaṃ* is 
the **inactive object** of the verb *bhāsissaṃ*. 

**Note**:  In the comment unit above, the word order of the commented unit is changed 
to clarify the relation between *abhidhammatthasaṅgahaṃ* and *bhāsissaṃ*. Such a com-
ment serves to indicate the word-to-word relations, hence the term *relational comment*. 

 The phrase *iti sambandho*, having the sense "This is the relation", is typical of this 
type but not an essential component --- whenever the word order of a commented unit is 
changed to throw light on the relations within it, it can be termed a **relational comment**.1 


                                                 1 It should be noted, however, that it is also possible to use relational comments for some indeclinables 
having no relation to other words if such an explanation would serve to make the syntax clearer. 

 For example,  
 -   buddhaṃ dhammaṃ saṇgañca abhivādiya (*Commented unit*)  
 -    buddhañca dhammañca saṇgañca abhivādiyāti sambandho (*Comment unit*)  
 -    The phrase " *buddhañca dhammañca*" implies that *ca* of *saṇgañca* is the conjunction that joins  *buddhaṃ*, *dhammaṃ*, and *saṇgaṃ* together.
