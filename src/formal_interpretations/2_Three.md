# **B.Three Types of Comments**
 1. **Iti** Comment (*Ulliṅga*)  
 1. **Non-iti** Comment (*Vutti*)  
 1. **Relational** Comment (*Sambandha*)  
**Examples** 
   
    **1. --Poso**ti Puriso:- In this sentence, the commented unit *poso* is explained as having the sense, "man". It is termed as **iti comment** due to the use of the indeclinable iti. 
   
    **2. --Poso** Puriso:- Here the explanation is the same, but *iti* is not used; therefore, it is la-
belled **non-iti comment**.  
    
    **3**.  --Abhivādiya bhāsissaṃ  abhidhammatthasaṅgahaṃ. (*Commented unit*)  
     
    **abhidhammatthasaṅgahaṃ bhāsissanti** sambandho. (*Comment unit*)
    
     The phrase *abhidhamma* --- *sambandho* implies that *abhidhammattha- saṅgahaṃ* is 
the **inactive object** of the verb *bhāsissaṃ*. 

**Note**:  In the comment unit above, the word order of the commented unit is changed 
to clarify the relation between *abhidhammatthasaṅgahaṃ* and *bhāsissaṃ*. Such a com-
ment serves to indicate the word-to-word relations, hence the term *relational comment*. 

 The phrase *iti sambandho*, having the sense "This is the relation", is typical of this 
type but not an essential component --- whenever the word order of a commented unit is 
changed to throw light on the relations within it, it can be termed a **relational comment**.1
