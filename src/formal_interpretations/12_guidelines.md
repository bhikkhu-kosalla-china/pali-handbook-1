# **General Guidelines for Formal Interpretations** 

**Primary Derivatives as Commented Units** 

 - 1.   When an *inactive object* not mentioned with a commented *primary derivative* is in-
serted into its comment unit, the *subjective suffixal case* is usually indicated. 

     Ex. **labhito**ti cīvaraṃ labhito
 
 - 2.   When  an  *inactive  subject*  not  mentioned  with  a  commented  *primary  derivative*  is 
inserted into its comment unit, the *objective suffixal case* is usually indicated. 

        Ex. **labhito**ti bhikkhunā labhito 
 
 - 3.   When a *primary derivative* is commented using the words such as  *yutta*, *anuccha-
vika* (suitable, proper), *arahati* (should be, deserves to be, be worthy of), *sakkā* (possible, 
capable), the *objective suffixal case* is usually indicated. 

         Ex. **karaṇīyan**ti karituṃ yuttaṃ
 
 - 4.   When a *primary derivative* unit is commented 
     
        1.with its *abstractive derivative*   
        2. with another *primary derivative* with the suffix ana or,  
        3.by compounding it with the stem *bhāva*, or, *ākāra* ---    the *verbal suffixal case* is usually indicated. 

      Ex. **labhito**ti labhitatā / labhanaṃ / labhitabhāvo / labhitākāro
      
 - 5.   If  the  suffixal  case  of  a  commented  *primary  derivative*  is  not  obvious,  yet  if  it  is 
commented using the *abstract derivative* of another having an unmistakable *subjective* or 
*objective  suffixal  case*,  or  by  compounding  the  same  with  the  stem  -  *bhāva*,  then  it  indi-
cates that the commented unit has the corresponding *suffixal case* and that its content must 
be taken in the *abstract sense*. 

     Ex. **gamanan**ti gacchantatā / gacchantattaṃ / gacchantabhāvo  
      gamanaṃ - the state of the one who goes (the abstract sense of a *primary          derivative with subjective suffixal case*)
