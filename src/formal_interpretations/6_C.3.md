# **C. 3 Conjugated Verb indications** 

 As shown in the topic of **Conjugations**, conjugated verbs are derived generally 
from verbal stems and, occasionally, direct from roots. Consequently, a conjugated verb 
may be a combination of a verbal stem, or a root, with a verbal ending. If a part or the 
whole of a *commented unit* is a **conjugated verb**, its *comment unit* would be concerned 
with its root (if it is formed by adding a verbal ending to a root), or its verbal stem (if 
formed by adding a verbal ending to a verbal stem), the sense of either of them, the verbal 
ending or its sense.
