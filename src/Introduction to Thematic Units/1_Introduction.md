**Introduction** 

There are two kinds of relations usually defined to analyze given Pali text, namely, 
*word-to-word* relations and *sentence-to-sentence* ones. The former is used to get the 
syntactic sense of a sentence and has been discussed in *Basic / Advanced Relational 
Grammar*. The latter is used to get the accurate picture of logical relations among 
sentences of a paragraph, a chapter or even a volume. This topic is an introduction to 
*sentence-to-sentence* relations.
