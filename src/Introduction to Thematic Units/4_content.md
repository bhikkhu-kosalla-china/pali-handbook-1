**Essential Content** (*Piṇḍattha*) 

  The term **essential content** is used in contrast with the *literal content*.  
For example, a simple sentence counting the Triple Gems as Buddha, Dhamma and 
Saṅgha is **literally different** from a whole chapter explaining them in detail one by one; 
but they are **essentially the same** in content. Why? Because the subject matter is the same, 
i.e., the Triple Gems. 

The **essential content** of a thematic unit is related to that of its **previous** or **fol-
lowing one** in one of following three ways: 

a. Identity 

b. Cause / effect (premise / conclusion) 

c. ordinary connection.
