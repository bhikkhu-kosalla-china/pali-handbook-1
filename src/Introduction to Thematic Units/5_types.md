**Types of Thematic Units** 

  The type of a given **thematic unit** is defined in reference to its preceding and 
following ones. For instance, if a unit is an **elaboration** of the previous one but serves as 
one of **partial content** to the following one, it is termed as the unit of both **elaboration** 
and **partial content**. Accordingly, types of thematic units are usually given in pairs; in 
each pair, each member has its type defined in reference to another. 

 Depending on the relation of their **essential contents**, they are divided into three 
classes.
