**Thematic Markers** (*VƒÅkyajotakas*)

  Many thematic units are marked by certain indeclinables, namely, *hi, ca*, or *pana*. 
They are usually placed **immediately after** the **initial words** of their respective sentences. 
In theory, they are similar to English conjunctions --- they are said to illuminate the 
thematic relations among *thematic units*. In practice, however, each of them is used to in-
dicate almost all relations possible; it is almost impossible to rely on them when they are 
so overloaded.  
The actual process is rather the reverse. A thematic marker is only a signal that in-
dicates the necessity to analyze the thematic relation of its HOST unit to the PREVIOUS 
one. After the analysis has been finished and the relation found out, that relation is used to 
make a reasonable translation of the marker itself.
