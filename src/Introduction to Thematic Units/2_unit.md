**Thematic Unit** (*Vākya*)  
  The Pali term *vākya* literally means "a sentence", i.e., a self-contained set of words, 
in which syntactic word-to-word relations can be properly defined without going out of 
the set. However, it means here an independent unit of content or subject matter, hence the 
term **thematic unit**. The **smallest thematic unit** is a **sentence** and each of them may 
combine to form larger ones --- with their extents ranging from **two or more sentences** up 
to **a whole paragraph or chapter**, or **even a whole volume**.
